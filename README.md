# Employee Facial Login
This project involves the implementation of an employee login system using facial recognition. 😄

The project was deployed via AWS, is running on a t2.micro EC2 instance and can be accessed via this [link](http://bit.ly/employee-login-ls). 🔗

The figure below shows how to add an employee to the database by uploading a picture of the employee and then logging in with a different picture of the same employee. 📷🔀👤

## Architecture
The architecture of the project is shown in the following figure:
<p align=center>

</p>

An API gateway, configured as a REST API, connects to the AWS services needed to add employee images to the database and authenticate the employee by searching for the person in the database. ✨

The employee registration is done by adding the image to an S3 bucket, which triggers a Lambda function responsible for retrieving the person ID from the AWS Rekognition service and storing it in DynamoDB. 📷🔍

The authentication process is performed by a lambda function responsible for storing the visitor's image, retrieving the person ID from the Rekognition service, and then searching for the ID in the database. The authentication is successful if the person is registered as an employee in DynamoDB. ✅

The CI/CD process is also implemented using Docker and GitHub actions. A Docker container image is created and pushed to Amazon ECR. Then, the latest image is pulled to an Amazon EC2 instance running the application. GitHub Actions is responsible for automatically pulling the latest image to the EC2 instance. 🐳🚀

### TODO
* [ ] Add photo to database and authentication via camera;
* [ ] Improve frontend (I am not the best on frontend development);
* [ ] Separate access to add employee - it should not be in the same endpoint as authentication (it is just a demo).

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
